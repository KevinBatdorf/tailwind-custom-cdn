## How it works
1. Submit a PR with a config file under the `configs/` directory. You may use subfolders if you wish. If you add any other file the PR will fail. The PR should have only a single, standard Tailwind CSS config file.
2. If all goes well, The PR will auto merge and a Release will be created.
3. Every time there is a new release from Tailwind CSS, a new build will be created
> âš  Be polite and keep the file names appropriate enough. We're all adults here :)

## How to use
The system will auto release on any push to master. After a few minutes, you should be able to use your script in the following way:

## FAQ
**Question:** Can I use this in production?

**Answer:** I wouldn't. For production you will want to use a build tool so that you can purge your unused CSS.

##
**Question:** Help! I made a mistake!

**Answer:** Just open a PR with the fix and I'll delete the original file so that the system will allow for the re-build. Be sure to tag me as I may not be monitoring everything here. Or you can just push a new config file with a different name.

##
**Question:** What about plugins?

**Answer:** Plugins aren't supported now, and I haven't looked into it. If there is some demand for plugins then I'll look into adding plugin support.
